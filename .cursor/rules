# Project Chimera - AI Assistant Rules

## Project Context
This is Project Chimera: An autonomous AI influencer network using Planner-Worker-Judge pattern.

## Prime Directive
NEVER write code without first checking the specs/ directory.

## Architecture Rules
1. Use Planner-Worker-Judge pattern only
2. All external connections via MCP
3. Database: PostgreSQL for transactions, Weaviate for memory
4. Security: No hardcoded secrets, validate all inputs

## File Structure
project-chimera/
├── specs/           # READ THIS FIRST
├── src/            # Source code
├── skills/         # Agent capabilities
└── tests/          # Test files

## Before Coding
1. Explain what you plan to build
2. Reference which spec section it implements
3. Consider security implications
4. Plan testing approach
