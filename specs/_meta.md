# Project Chimera — Master Specification

## Project Context
Project Chimera is an autonomous influencer system designed to research trends, generate content, and manage engagement across social platforms with minimal human intervention. The system is built using a hierarchical agent architecture and emphasizes safety, traceability, and governance.

## Core Principles
- Spec-driven development: specifications are the source of truth.
- Agents must never act outside defined constraints.
- Human oversight is applied selectively based on risk and confidence.
- All external interactions occur through MCP servers.

## Constraints
- No production code should be written without an approved spec.
- Agents must respect platform policies and ethical boundaries.
- Financial actions require explicit governance rules.

## Non-Goals
- This project does not aim to optimize virality at the cost of safety.
- Agents are not allowed to impersonate real humans.
