# OpenClaw Network Integration

## Purpose
Allow Chimera agents to connect with other AI agents in the OpenClaw network.

## Basic Integration
1. Register our agents with OpenClaw

3. Share non-sensitive information
4. Collaborate on content projects

## Safety Rules

- Human approval for major collaborations
- Monitor all external interactions
